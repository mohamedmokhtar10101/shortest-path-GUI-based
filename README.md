this is my first gui application to get the shortest path of given nodes in a graph using c++ with QT implemented with dijkstra algorithm

application features:

1- create nodes graphically

2- attach node to another graphically with arrow-ended line and a number associated with that edge

3- select the target nodes by double clicking and single righ click

4- get the shortest path between them by "shortest path button"

5- the shortest path graphically manifested as a red edges among nodes

6- reset to pick another target nodes

7- delete button to delete all nodes and reinitialize the program
